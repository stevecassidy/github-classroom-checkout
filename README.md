# Github Classroom Tool

This project provides a tool to checkout all of the
student github repositories for one or more workshops.  It
assumes that you have password-less checkout configured
for github.

`classroom.py COMP2200-weekly.json` will report on the status of students
and then clone all repositories in the list of workshops specified in the JSON file.
